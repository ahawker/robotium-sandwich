Robotium-Sandwich
=================

Create beatifully abstract UI automation tests for Android apps


Introduction
------------

Building large and scalable test suites using Robotium can be a challenging task. Without a carefuly designed abstraction 
library, one can quickly end up with tests that are impossible to maintain, difficult to expand and full of a boiler-plate 
code. Robotium-Sandwich is a library that sits on top of Android instrumentation and Robotium that addresses this problem.
Robotium-Sandwich makes it super easy to create page object like definitions for different screens of your app and to write
abstract tests free of boiler-plate.

Concept
-------

Robotium-Sandwich tests are broken into two parts: screen definition classes and tests themselves.
